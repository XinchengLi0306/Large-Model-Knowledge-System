# Large Model Knowledge System 大模型知识体系

The course itself is divided into ten parts.
<br/>

The notes on learning big models cover the column "Machine Learning" in the knowledge system of big models / the column "Deep Learning PyTorch & TensorFlow" / the column "Reinforcement Learning" / the column "Transformer Architecture" / the column "Fine-tuning Deployment" / the column "Multimodal Mockup" etc.<br/>
